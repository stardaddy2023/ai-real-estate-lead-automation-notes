Here is the definitive list of  **Non-Judicial Foreclosure States** (often called "Deed of Trust" states).

These are your "Speed Markets." In these states, lenders do **not** need to sue the borrower to foreclose; they simply exercise the "Power of Sale" clause in the contract. Timelines are typically **3–6 months** (vs. 1–3 years in Judicial states), making them ideal for the **ARELA Protocol** "Hunter" module.

### **The "Hybrid" States (Proceed with Caution)**

_These states allow Non-Judicial foreclosure, but specific laws often force lenders into Judicial courts, or the process is easily stalled by homeowners._

- **Hawaii** (Technically allows non-judicial, but changes in the law made it so risky that most lenders now use Judicial).
    
- **Oklahoma** (Non-judicial is allowed, but the homeowner can force it into court with one letter).
    
- **New Mexico** (Recently added a non-judicial option, but it is rarely used; still functions like a Judicial state).
    

### **Strategic Insight for Your Platform**

If you are building the **"Market Hunter"** module, you should apply a **"Speed Filter"** to your lead generation.

**Priority Tier 1 (Fastest/Best for Wholesaling):**

1. **Georgia** (30-45 days)
    
2. **Texas** (40-60 days)
    
3. **Missouri** (30-45 days)
    
4. **Arizona** (90 days)
    
5. **Nevada** (120 days)
    

**Avoid/Deprioritize (Judicial Nightmares):**

- **New York, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey.** (These are "graveyards" for wholesalers because deals die while waiting 2 years for a court date).
