**STRATEGY ACTIVE: THE "SOFT INTERROGATION" SCRIPT**

The biggest mistake investors make is asking, _"How much do you owe?"_ too early. It kills the rapport.

To get the **Bucket 1 Data** (Mortgage Balance, Rate, PITI) without sounding like a debt collector, we use a technique called **"Triangulation."** We act like we are trying to help them net the most money, and the debt is just an obstacle we need to clear.

Here is your **Master Script** for the "Golden Goose" Investor.

### PHASE 1: THE "WHY" (Uncovering Motivation)

_Goal: Find out if they actually need to sell. If they don't, creative finance won't work._

You: "I know you're busy, so I'll be brief. I'm looking for a property in [Neighborhood] to add to my portfolio. I saw yours and it looked like it might fit what I'm looking for. I'm just curious, are you strictly looking to sell right now, or were you just testing the market to see what you could get?"

Seller: "Well, we need to sell because..."

You: "Oh, I see. [Mirror their reason]. Is there a specific deadline you're trying to beat?"

### PHASE 2: THE "WHAT" (Condition Pivot)

_Goal: Lower their price expectation before you talk numbers._

You: "The market is a bit weird right now. Before we talk price, is there anything major I'd need to fix? Roof, A/C, Plumbing? Be honest—I'm not looking for a museum piece, just need to know what I'm walking into."

Seller: "It needs a new roof."

You: "Okay, ouch. Roofs are expensive these days. Anything else?"

### PHASE 3: THE "HOW" (Extracting Bucket 1 Data)

_Goal: Get the debt info. Use the **"Free & Clear" Trap**._

**You:** "Okay, I think I can work with that. Now, typically I pay cash, but sometimes if the numbers are tight, I can pay more if we get creative. Let me ask you—is the property free and clear, or is there a mortgage we need to pay off at closing?"

**Scenario A: They say "Free and Clear."**

- **Action:** You are negotiating Cash or Owner Finance (Seller Carry).
    

**Scenario B: They say "There is a mortgage."**

- **Action:** Proceed to the **Sub-To Extraction Sequence:**
    

You: "Got it. So whatever we agree on, we have to pay off the bank first. Do you have a rough idea of what the payoff balance is? Just a ballpark."

Seller: "About $240,000."

You: "Okay. And I assume the payment is manageable? What are you paying monthly right now?"

Seller: "It's about $1,450."

You: "Does that include taxes and insurance (PITI), or is that separate?"

Seller: "That includes everything."

You: "Okay, that seems pretty low for a $240k balance. Did you refinance a few years ago when rates were super low?"

Seller: "Yeah, we got in at like 3% back in 2021."

You: "Wow, that's a great asset. You definitely don't want to lose that rate."

### PHASE 4: THE "PLANTING THE SEED" (The Pitch)

_Goal: Test the waters for Subject-To._

You: "Here's the problem. If I pay cash, I have to offer you a discount because I have to pay closing costs, fix the roof, and make a profit. I'd probably be around [Lowball Cash Offer].

BUT...

If you're open to it, I might be able to pay you Full Price (or close to it) if you let me take over that monthly payment of $1,450. I'd cover the closing costs, I'd handle the repairs, and I'd just start making payments to the bank for you. That way, you walk away without writing a check, and your credit is protected. Would you be open to hearing an offer like that?"
