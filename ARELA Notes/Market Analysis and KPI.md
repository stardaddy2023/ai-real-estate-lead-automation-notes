# **STRATEGY SHIFT: MACRO ANALYSIS**
### 1. THE "PEOPLE" METRIC: Population Growth + Migration

Don't just look for "Growth." Look for **Net Migration**.

- **The Metric:** We want to see **>1% annual population growth** for 3 consecutive years.
    
- **The Nuance:** _Who_ is moving there? Are they retirees (fixed income, low economic velocity) or working-age professionals (high wages, forming households)?
    
- **Golden Goose Signal:** Look for cities where U-Haul prices are higher _entering_ than _leaving_.
    

### 2. THE "MONEY" METRIC: Job Growth & Diversity

Never invest in a "One-Horse Town" (e.g., a city dependent on a single military base or one factory).

- **The Metric:** Job growth should outpace the national average (currently ~1.5 - 2%).
    
- **The Diversity Test:** No single industry should make up more than 25% of the employment base.
    
- **Why:** If the tech sector crashes, a diverse market (Healthcare, Education, Logistics) stays afloat.
    

### 3. THE "RENTAL" METRIC: Price-to-Rent Ratio (RTP)

This tells you if a market is better for **Flipping** or **Holding**.

- **Formula:** Median Home Price / Annual Median Rent.2
    
- **The Target:**
    
    - **RTP > 20:** (e.g., San Francisco). It's cheaper to rent than buy. **Strategy:** Flip only. Cash flow is impossible.
        
    - **RTP < 15:** (e.g., Midwest). Rents are high compared to price. **Strategy:** Buy & Hold / BRRRR heaven.
        
- **Your Sweet Spot:** As a cash-heavy investor, look for an RTP between **12-16**. This offers a blend of appreciation and cash flow.
    

### 4. THE "SUPPLY" METRIC: Months of Inventory (Absorption Rate)

This tells you who has the leverage: The Buyer or the Seller.

- **The Metric:**
    
    - **< 3 Months:** Seller's Market (Prices rising fast, hard to get deals).
        
    - **4-6 Months:** Balanced Market (Healthy).3
        
    - **> 6 Months:** Buyer's Market (Prices softening, easy to negotiate creative terms).
        
- **Creative Tip:** For your "Subject-To" strategy, target markets with **high inventory (5+ months)**. Sellers who can't sell are more willing to let you take over their payments.
    

### 5. THE "DISTRESS" METRIC: Shadow Inventory

This is for your **Wholesale** and **Wholetail** goals.

- **The Metric:** Look for a spike in **Pre-Foreclosure filings** or **Delinquency Rates (30+ days late)**.
    
- **Why:** This indicates a wave of motivated sellers is coming.
    
- **Where to find it:** Data providers like PropStream or local County Clerk records
