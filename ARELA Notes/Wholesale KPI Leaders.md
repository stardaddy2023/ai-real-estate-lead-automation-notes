Based on the latest data for **Late 2025**, here are the top Non-Judicial states ranked by the "Wholesale Trinity": **High Fees + High Liquidity + Speed**.

While Arizona is your home turf, the data shows **Georgia and Texas** are currently outperforming it for pure wholesaling metrics.

### **Strategic Breakdown**

#### **1. The "Big Check" Winner: Georgia (Atlanta Metro)**

- **Why:** Georgia combines speed with massive fees. The average assignment fee is **$22k** (vs. $5k in Arizona).
    
- **Liquidity:** Institutional funds (hedge funds) are still buying aggressively in Atlanta suburbs, keeping the cash buyer pool deep.
    
- **Speed:** Non-judicial foreclosure can happen in just over a month. Motivation is high.
    

#### **2. The "Volume" Winner: Texas (Houston & San Antonio)**

- **Why:** Houston is the volume king. It has high distress (foreclosures) and affordable entry prices (median $265k).
    
- **The Play:** "Sub-to" deals work incredibly well here because Texas law is clear, and the economy is robust. You can move 5-10 contracts a month here easier than almost anywhere else.
    
- **Foreclosure:** Auctions are always the **first Tuesday of the month**. This creates a predictable rhythm for your "Hunter" module.
    

#### **3. The "Hidden Gem": Missouri (St. Louis)**

- **Why:** St. Louis currently has the **highest average assignment fee** in the nation for a single city (~$25k).
    
- **Speed:** It has arguably the fastest foreclosure timeline in the US (~21 days).
    
- **The Trap:** It is block-by-block. One street is A-class, the next is a war zone. You need a very calibrated "Lead Scorer" (AI Agent) to avoid bad inventory.
    

#### **4. The "Home Base": Arizona**

- **Reality Check:** Arizona is safe and stable, but margins have compressed. The average assignment fee is lower (~$5k-$7k) because the market is efficient and competition is high.
    
- **Pivot:** To win in AZ, you must focus on **Creative Finance** (Subject-To) rather than cash wholesaling. The spread is in the interest rate, not the equity.

### **Recommendation for Your Platform**

If you want to maximize **"Quick Cash"** for your users (or yourself), I recommend pointing your **"Market Hunter"** agent at:

1. **Atlanta, GA (Zip codes: 30331, 30032)** -> Target: Tired Landlords (High Fees).
    
2. **Houston, TX (Zip codes: 77033, 77076)** -> Target: Pre-Foreclosures (High Volume).
    
3. **St. Louis, MO (County, not City)** -> Target: Vacant High Equity (High Speed).
    

Shall we set up a "Hunter" search criteria specifically for **Atlanta** or **Houston** to test this theory?
